            <p>In 2023 I left my acquirer just two years into a three year contract ‚Äì forfeiting millions.</p>

            <p>Was it worth it?</p>

            <p>First, a bit of context.</p>

            <p>In 2021 my cofounder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickelledge/">Nick Elledge</a> and I sold <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/datafleets/">DataFleets</a> to LiveRamp for >$100mm. Within about a month of joining the acquirer, I realized the integration was going to be extremely difficult.</p>

            <div class="article-sections">
                <section>
                    <h2>üë™ (1) Family</h2>
                    <p>My wife and I were thrilled to welcome a baby boy to our family in 2022. Spending time with them is one of my greatest joys. But in corporate life, I felt my time with them was robbed. I had little control over my calendar at work, and despite being constantly busy we were moving a fraction of the pace I would find acceptable in a well functioning startup.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>üß† (2) Mental health</h2>
                    <p>Though not diagnosed with it, I'm pretty sure I was depressed. I'm an inherently optimistic person. Even amidst 100 hour work weeks and near death experiences with DataFleets, I felt energized, driven, and optimistic. But my inherent optimism was waning.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>üöÄ (3) Hunger for impact</h2>
                    <p>About a year into our M&A integration I realized something: the thing I was most proud of in my career was not the company I had just sold. Instead, it was the work I had done at Digital Reasoning to get its healthcare vertical off the ground ‚Äì which has since been spun out as Azra AI.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>‚õèÔ∏è (4) I missed the grind</h2>
                    <p>It seems counterintuitive‚Äì on the one hand, I wanted more time to spend with my family, but on the other hand I missed the "grind" of a startup. But for me, it's not about the quantity of hours worked. It's how those hours are spent and the flexibility of when those hours are worked that matter.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>ü§ù (5) I missed setting the culture</h2>
                    <p>If I were to summarize the type of culture I like to create, it's one of deep thought, speed, peer-to-peer accountability, functional excellence, and ambition. Setting that culture has many levers: chief among them are hiring/firing, promotions, and intentional behaviors from leadership.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>ü§ñ (6) AI Opportunity</h2>
                    <p>I first fell in love with AI while I was studying ancient greek in undergrad. I found myself spending more time learning computational linguistics to translate my homework than actually doing the work myself.</p>
                </section>
            </div>

            <h2>‚ùìWas it worth it ‚ùì</h2>
            <p>One year in, the decision to leave early and forfeit the money was one of the best I've made. The connection I've built with my son was well worth it in its own right. And the fulfillment I've found in jumping back into the unknown and aiming even higher with a new venture has been the icing on the cake.</p>
