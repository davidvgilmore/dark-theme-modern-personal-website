            <p>The concept of artificial intelligence has piqued our imaginations and challenged our sense of humanity since its conception over 70 years ago. For decades we have made predictions that intelligent machines will transform society. In some ways, they have. In others, they haven't.</p>

            <p>Instead of considering whether AI will be "transformative", in this post I consider a specific question: <strong>when will AI outthink humans — in terms of <em>volume</em> of thought?</strong></p>

            <p>More specifically, I'm framing the concept of "outthinking" in two orthogonal dimensions: the <em>volume</em> of tokens and <em>intelligence</em> of tokens. And I only consider the former in this post.</p>

                <h2>Part 1: watt-hours → thought-hours</h2>
                <p>In an interview with Patrick Collison, Jensen Huang juxtaposed the units of the industrial revolution ($/kWh) to the AI revolution ($/M tokens).</p>

                <h2>The "horsepower" of the cognitive revolution</h2>
                <p>It's not clear to most people how an LLM "token" correlates to value. By analogy, in the early days of the steam engine there wasn't a clear way for potential adopters to intuitively quantify its capabilities vs alternatives (e.g. horses).</p>

                <h2>Estimating tokens per thought-hour</h2>
                <p>To come up with an estimate for tokens per hour, let's start with the assumption that humans read at an average rate of 200 words per minute, or roughly 250 tokens per minute.</p>

                <h2>Reasoning about utility-scale AI</h2>
                <p>As we see more adoption of AI models at near-utility scale, we'll need some way to reason about the vast volumes of tokens consumed and produced, and thought-hours may be a way to juxtapose those volumes with the human cognitive labor force.</p>

                <h2>Part 2: human vs AI thought-hours</h2>
                <p>When contemplating the future where AI outthinks humans, we must integrate both human and synthetic cognitive capacities.</p>

                <h2>Implications</h2>
                <p>If these even projections are directionally correct, what does that mean for society? If you also believe AI models are going to get "smarter" over this same time period, the impact can definitely be societal-scale.</p>
